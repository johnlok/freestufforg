freestufforg
============

This is a web application whose purpose is to allow users to list free items they would like to give away. A group project with [Aero Wong](https://github.com/AeroWong/) and [Kristen Shimatsu](https://github.com/kshimatsu).

Highlights include an image uploader with S3 integration, email interaction and notification,  PostgreSQL implementation and of course...free stuff.

The app is hosted [here](https://freestuff-jka.herokuapp.com/).
